# Superhero Team Dueling
Getting more familiar with object oriented programming by creating an application that pits two superhero teams against each other. Heroes are equipped with abilities, weapons and armor. They attack and take damage and until their health reaches zero.

## User Stories
- Users are prompted to choose a team name
- Users can specify how many heroes are on each team.
- Users can name each hero
- Users can provide heroes with armor, abilities, and weapons
- Users can assign armor name and block value
- Users can assign ability name and attack strength
- Users can assign weapon name and attack strength
- Users are shown stats (which team won, who died, kill/death ratio)
- Users are asked if they want to play again

## Topics Covered
- Classes
- Objects
- Constructors
- Methods
- Properties
- Inheritance

## Test Coverage
Test driven development! Worked with pytest, included code to verify that program functions properly.

## Stretch Challenges
- Add command line interface that allows for recreating or editing of teams
- Allow use of only "authorized" abilities, weapons, and armor controlled by the Arena.
- Add tests that cover more edge cases.
- Change the way health is dealt out across the team. i.e. create heroes that may take damage first or may take more of the team's damage.
- Write additional classes that implement different ways to attack or defend -- i.e. create a relic class that only defends against abilities.
- Develop a way to steal weapons and abilities from the opposing team.
- Add rewards for team success such as weapon drops.
