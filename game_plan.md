## Create a superhero team.
* **Use Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    * **Classes**: A Blueprint that describes methods and properties in object. Computers use that specification to instantiate the object in memory.
    * **Properties**: Unique values accessible by objects
    * **Constructors**: Creates an object in memory. Initializes object with unique values at creation. Use **_init_** method to set initial values.
* **Make Code Modular**
    * Built-in **_name_** variable
* **Create a Game Loop**
    * check for user input, check length of time between loops, update game state, render output to screen
